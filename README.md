[Bempp](https://bempp.com/) version 3.3.4 ([source code](https://bitbucket.org/bemppsolutions/bempp/src/master/)) or 3.3.5 ([Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/bempp/notebook)) 

The folders **8aggregate_xGHz/** contain the mesh files for the 8 branch aggregate at four frequencies: 50GHz, 183GHz, 325GHz and 664GHz.

The notebook **8branch_aggregate.ipynb** can be used to replicate the results from Section 5, and can be adjusted to produce results from Section 4.
